## 🧠 About me
I am an engineer working at the intersection of ML and robotics.  
This page is a **showcase of my projects** and tracks my engineering evolution: from minimalistic prototypes to production-grade solutions.
- 🔭 Currently working on: **"Sentinel Drone"** - a personal R&D project.
- 🌱 Currently learning: **Deep learning** and neural networks with **PyTorch**.
- 👯 Looking to collaborate on: Innovative projects in **ML+Robotics**.

## 🧩 Tech stack
- **Languages:** Python, C++, Bash
- **AI/ML:** PyTorch, TensorFlow
- **Robotics:** MAVSTD, STM32, Arduino, electronics, mechanics
  
## 🛠 My projects

- [**ML-engine**](https://github.com/v0lia/ML-engine) — my modular deep learning engine with logging, TensorBoard visualization, checkpointing and pluggable CNN architectures  
- [**drone-utils**](https://github.com/v0lia/drone-tools) — tools for logging on linux and drone compass calibration
 
## ⚙️ Engineering Vector
- **Modularity** - building agile, transparent, and scalable systems
- **Minimalism** - achieving control through simplicity
- **Transparency** - systems expose their state through metrics, logs, and visualizations
